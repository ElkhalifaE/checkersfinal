# checkersfinal

This was a project I started during the Spring break of 2021

Features:
- Hosts 10 checkers game rooms live (20 players)
- Automatically disconnects clients after 30 minutes
- Ends the game if one of the clients disconnects and notifies the other player

Limitations:
- No multijump
- No database to store users and their account data (like wins, losses and rating)
